These notebooks are from an attempt to run ChromVAR on custom peak sets on the fly. To do so we use Ben's BPCells which allows making peak x cell matrices on the fly quickly.

The code is taken out of the directory where it was run, so it won't run completely. Rather it's kept here as a template that can be used if it's ever required to make peak x cell matrices on the fly.
