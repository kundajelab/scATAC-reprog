From Pmat.ipynb:
- features.50d.tsv: x.sp@smat@dmat (reduced dimension representation from diffusion maps for each barcode)  
- features.9d.tsv: same as above, for first 9 dimensions which are used for UMAP.
- metadata.tsv: contains UMAP coordinates
- peaks.bed: contains all peaks from snap files (not just those used for diff map + UMAP).
- pmat.sparse.mm: contains raw insertions in each of the above peaks for each of the cells.
