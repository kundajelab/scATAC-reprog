# ChromBPNet for scATAC-seq of reprogramming
Minimal, self-contained ChromBPNet implementation used to train models on pseudobulks from scATAC-seq of human fibroblast reprogramming to iPSCs. Please refer to https://github.com/kundajelab/chrombpnet for an up-to-date version.

Refer to `src/analysis/20200626_modeling_runs/chrombpnet-lite/jobscripts/` for scripts for training, evaluating, and interpreting models.

The data and trained models are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8299710.
